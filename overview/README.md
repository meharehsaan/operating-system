# Introduction to operating systems

## Linux

Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by **Linus Torvalds**. Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution (distro), which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project.

## Windows

Microsoft Windows is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families developed and marketed by **Microsoft**. Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry. For example, Windows NT for consumers, Windows Server for servers, and Windows IoT for embedded systems. Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x, Windows Mobile, and Windows Phone.

## MacOS

macOS (previously OS X and originally Mac OS X) is an operating system developed and marketed by **Apple** Inc. since 2001. It is the primary operating system for Apple's Mac computers. Within the market of desktop and laptop computers, it is the second most widely used desktop OS, after Microsoft Windows and ahead of Linux (including ChromeOS).

### The operating system's job

---

Your computer's operating system (OS) manages all of the software and hardware on the computer. Most of the time, there are several different computer programs running at the same time, and they all need to access your computer's central processing unit (CPU), memory, and storage. The operating system coordinates all of this to make sure each program gets what it needs.

#### Efficient Multitasking

One of the greatest advantages of operating systems is their ability to handle multitasking with finesse. OS allows you to run multiple programs simultaneously, switching between them seamlessly without any hiccups. Imagine listening to your favorite music while browsing the web, playing games, and working on a school project, all at the same time â€“ thanks to the magic of operating systems!

#### Device Management

Operating systems act as efficient managers for all the devices connected to a computer, such as printers, scanners, and external storage devices. They ensure that these devices work harmoniously with the computer, making it easier for you to print, scan, and transfer files without any hassle. OS takes care of all the nitty-gritty details, leaving you free to focus on your tasks.

#### User-friendly Interfaces

Operating systems come with user-friendly interfaces that make it easy for you to interact with your computer. With colorful icons, menus, and buttons, you can easily navigate through different programs and settings, making your computer experience smooth and enjoyable. Operating systems are like the superheroes that make your computer user-friendly and accessible!

#### Robust File Management

Managing files and folders can be a daunting task, but operating systems make it a breeze! They provide organized ways to store, search, and retrieve files, making it simple for you to find that homework assignment or your favorite video game. Operating systems act like your personal file organizers, keeping your digital world tidy and accessible.

#### Enhanced Security

Operating systems come with built-in security features that protect your computer from potential threats, such as viruses and malware. They provide firewalls, antivirus programs, and regular security updates to safeguard your computer and data from unauthorized access. Operating systems act as your digital bodyguards, ensuring that your computer remains safe and secure.
