# Operating System

Operating System `(OS)`, program that manages a computerâ€™s resources, especially the **allocation** of those **resources** among other programs. Typical resources include the **central processing unit (CPU), computer memory, file storage, input/output (I/O) devices, and network connections**. Management tasks include `scheduling` resource use to avoid conflicts and interference between programs. Unlike most programs, which complete a task and terminate, an operating system runs `indefinitely` and terminates only when the computer is **turned** off.
